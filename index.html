            <p>Prior to WWDC24, AI meant artificial intelligence to most consumers. In classic<br> Apple-esque fashion, we now know the Cupertino-based company wants to redefine AI as "Apple Intelligence."</p>

            <p>I watched IBM Think last week. As I listened to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, it struck me that we are <br> not thinking AI through. We are throwing AI at everything without prioritizing where we need it to focus.</p>

            <p>Having Google I/O immediately followed by Microsoft Build, with both conferences focused on AI, provided an interesting contrast between the <br>two companies’ approaches to AI. Microsoft is all about PCs for AI integration, while Google is all about smartphones.</p>

            <p>Microsoft blindsided Google with Copilot on search but failed to market the advantage successfully or advance it significantly enough to avoid a huge<br> pushback from Google. That pushback happened last week at Google I/O, and it was an impressive showing.</p>
